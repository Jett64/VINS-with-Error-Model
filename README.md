# VINS-with-Error-Model
**A modified version of VINS-Mono integrating a descriptor-based optical flow error model**, developed based on [vins-mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono).


This repository integrates a descriptor-based optical flow error model into VINS-Mono. The error model quantitatively assesses the quality of optical flow by utilizing the feature descriptor, then rejects outlier optical flow features and constructs an error model for visual measurements, thereby enhancing visual localization based on the optical flow quality.
